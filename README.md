# cwcbot

Discord bot writte in python to remind users that submit decks in a kog-decks channel, to do so on the website as well.

It uses discord.py v.1.0.0a and tinydb for the persistence.

To run this bot, you need python 3.6+ and the two requirements above.

Alternatively, if you have docker installed, you can just run `run.sh`. It will download and build a docker image, so the first time allow it few minutes to setup.
